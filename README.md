# Work-Hours-Counter-ARDUINO
  I needed a way to keep track of the time spent repairing amplifiers. Since I often work on several units in parallel—sometimes pausing one while waiting for parts— I decided to build a dedicated work hour counter. I had a nice 4-button keypad at stock, so I configured the system to handle four independent timers, one for each device.
  Although originally designed for amplifier repairs, this timer can be used to measure and manage the working time of any activity you choose.
